# Machine Learning Journey
This repo is a hub of the different machine learning algorithms I am learning and applying them on datasets, using google colab. I am incredibly amazed by the applications of Machine Learning and the different methodologies in solving problems and am eager to learn more. Working towards some kaggle competitions and incorporating algorithms in a MERN stack website (yay Software Engineering!) 


**Linear Regression**
* This refers to the Linear_Regression_Ecommerce file. Here, we look at data from an ecommerce website on indivisuals on their website or other platforms. 
* It starts with some exploratory data analysis using matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn
* Then, we create a linear regression model to predict the yearly amount of time spent interacting with the company based on features such as the Time on the App or length of membership
* The Linear Regression Model is then evaluated using mean absolute error, mean square error, and root mean sqaure error. The root mean square error was looked at more heavily, because it punishes outliers like the mse, but is in units that are understanable. 



**Logistic Regression**
**KNN**
**Decision Tree's and Random Forests**
